                    been to summer
                    trusteeship school in local area to organize a
                    community class for children to introduce our iGEM team and
                    knowledge about sleep.
                    As the project of our
                    team this year is to regularly express the melatonin in the
                    intestine environment,
                    our project is closely
                    related to sleep. According to the results of our survey, most
                    people don't pay much
                    attention to their sleeping
                    quality, or their ways of sleep regulating is not scientific.
                    Their knowledge about
                    sleep needs to be strengthened,
                    and we believe that teaching children sleep is an important way
                    to solve this social
                    problem. Thus, we stressed the
                    importance of sleep, and informed them when is the best time to
                    sleep as well as how
                    long they need to sleep per day.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children in trusteeship
                        school are all devoted
                        into our class. Actually, some of them has considerate
                        confusion about sleep,
                        but they did not have much chance to access the knowledge
                        about this area. They
                        asked why we will dream and why our eyes will
                        move when we sleep. In order to let student fully understand
                        what we taught to
                        them, we have arranged a schedule of our activities.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning, we separated
                        all the students in
                        two groups. During our activities, we had lots of questions
                        for the students,
                        which group’s answer was right, we gave them one point. At
                        the end of all of our
                        activities, we awarded the higher group’s students
                        a peppermint.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then came to the first
                        activity. The name of
                        the activity was “how long will you sleep”. The aim of the
                        activity was to
                        know most student how long would they sleep and then gave
                        them some advice. We
                        offered the students the opportunity to discuss
                        how long will they sleep at their age is most reasonable.
                        Then two groups of
                        students told us how long and why. Their answers were
                        literally convincing. At last we drew the conclusion that
                        how long should a
                        person sleep varies from different ages.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second activity was that
                        our team member
                        organized a game which can help children strongly remember
                        what is the best time
                        to go to sleep. The rule of the game was a little bit like
                        musical chair. We
                        just replaced the music into slogan “It’s 10 o’clock”. There
                        was a research
                        showed 10 o’clock in the evening is the best time to sleep.
                        Thus we made
                        students enforce their sensitive to “10 o’clock”.
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third activity was a team
                        member telling
                        students what is a sleep pattern. The sleep pattern was told
                        in a understandable
                        way by describing a boy’s sleep process. Students asked a
                        lot of meaningful
                        question such as why we dream. We told them there was two
                        period of our sleeping
                        process: one is rapid eye movement, the other one is
                        non-rapid eye movement. I
                        believe they fully understand the two periods.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last activity was a game
                        to made a clock by
                        the cardboard. We would like to let the students arrange
                        their time of the day.
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The class attracted many
                        children and their
                        parents. In the class, kids gained knowledge about sleep,
                        understood the
                        importance of sleep and let the kids know how to reasonably
                        arrange their daily
                        schedule. After the class, the parents and the children
                        asked lots of questions
                        related to scientific sleep. Our team members explained to
                        them patiently.
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt that sleep is a
                        significant part of our
                        daily life. Thus, we hoped to do our bits to raise the
                        children’s awareness
                        about the sleep and encourage them to be curious in our
                        project, particularly
                        when our project is so close to everyone’s daily life.

                    2017 Architects
                    Competition of Microorganism
                    Application: Human /Animal Health in September and October. The
                    competition included
                    the first oral defense and the final. Three of the team members,
                    student team leader
                    of team “SCU-WestChina”, and two advisors of our association
                    were present as judging
                    panel.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This competition required
                    contestants participate in
                    the competition in groups. And
                    each group should design their project about Human /Animal
                    Health. Then the groups
                    took part in the defense to present their project. Finally,
                    based on their project
                    feasibility, creativity, safety and so on, the groups were
                    awarded different prizes.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the first oral defense, 7
                    teams were chosen to
                    attend the final. The final was
                    held in the one of the largest classroom in Jiang’an Campus of
                    Sichuan University.
                    More than 10 professors attended as judges. After the final
                    defence, one gold award,
                    two silver awards and three bronze awards were issued.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIV mainly infects CD4+T
                        lymphocytes, and it
                        identifies host cells by binding the surface glycoprotein
                        gp120 to CD4 receptors
                        on
                        the surface of CD4+T lymphocytes. Cyanovirin-N(CV-N) is a
                        protein which can bind
                        nearly irreversibly to gp120 and changes its conformation,
                        so HIV has no chance
                        to
                        bond to CD4 receptors. But this bonding only happens during
                        the early time of
                        HIV
                        infection.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We intend to transfer the gene
                        that expresses the
                        CD4 protein into Lactobacillus
                        plantarum and transfer CV-N gene into the downstream of
                        Luxs-mediated quorum
                        sensing
                        system originally existing in lactobacillus plantarum. When
                        HIV enters the human
                        body, it will be bond to the engineering bacteria to form a
                        mass complex, which
                        will
                        lead to increase of the local density of the engineering
                        bacteria to the
                        threshold
                        value of the quorum sensing system. As a consequence,
                        engineering bacteria can
                        secret the CV-N protein immediately.

                        over its horizon.
                        However, this new therapy has not been applied clinically
                        due to the excessive
                        host specificity of natural bacteriophage. In response to
                        this problem, we use
                        site-specific recombination to widen the host range of
                        Streptococcus pneumoniae
                        phage Cp-1, making it infectious to <i>Streptococcus

                        synthetic biology.
                        Based on
                        the fact that Pichia pastoris contains acetyl coenzyme A
                        carboxylase, and by
                        using the strong promoter and gene mutation, we can increase
                        the yield of
                        epothilone and promote the conversion of other types of
                        epothilone. This can not
                        only achieve the high yield of epothilone B, but lay the
                        chemical production

                    <p class="scu_content_p">
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have developed a
                        insecticidal agent against
                        cockroaches, which is also destructive to other arthropods
                        but harmless to
                        humans and animals. Spores were collected by two-phase
                        liquid-solid method and
                        then made into sporopollen. The PLGA is then used to make
                        porous particles,
                        mixed with sporopollen, and then compressed into two fluted
                        blocks. Then the two
                        pieces are combined together to form a maze, where
                        aggregation pheromone
                        targeted cockroaches is put in to attract cockroaches. As
                        soon as a cockroach
                        touches the maze, it gets infected with spores and ends up
                        dying. Spores grow
                        into bacteria and will be released in the colony of
                        cockroaches causing more
                        cockroaches to die. In order to improve the insecticidal
                        effect, we have made a
                        modification of the <i>Beauveria bassiana</i>: we have
                        imported the fusion protein gene
                        with protease, chitinase and chitin binding domain of
                        cockroach and tps1 gene
                        associated with trehalose metabolism. And then integrate
                        them into the host
                        genome, in order to enhance the virulence and and resistance
                        of <i>Beauveria
                        bassiana</i>.

                        material and made into sweets eventually. Considering the

                        aiming at children, there is no doubt that our product will
                        be a success with proper propaganda methods.
